Given a student record, consisting of student ID and their marks for one particular subject, insert new student records by storing it in a Binary Search Tree and AVL Tree or search for existing record by fetching it from the tree.

Find and compare the time complexities in worst case and analyze which data structure is better in terms of time complexity for the given scenario.
